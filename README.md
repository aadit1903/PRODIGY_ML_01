**Introduction :**
This project focuses on predicting house prices using machine learning. I performed an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset and implemented three models to identify the best one for accurate predictions.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
Through EDA, I explored data distributions, handled missing values, and visualized key trends, which helped guide model selection.
